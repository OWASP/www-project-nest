## About OWASP Nest

OWASP Nest was originally created by **Arkadii Yakovets (Ark)** to simplify OWASP project navigation. Built from scratch based on Ark’s vision and discussions with **Starr Brown (Starr)**, the platform integrates structured system design into the OWASP ecosystem.

### Key Contributors

- **Arkadii Yakovets** -- Backend developer, leveraging over 10 years of experience in Python, Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), and related technologies. Built the backend using DRF, django-filter, OpenAI, Algolia Search, slack-bolt, PyGitHub, pre-commit, pytest, and more.
- **Kateryna Golovanova (Kate)** -- Led the initial frontend development using Vue.js and later became a project co-leader for her frontend and project management expertise.

### Evolution

Over time, OWASP Nest has expanded to address broader community needs, such as Google Summer of Code (GSoC) student guidance and contribution opportunities discovery. The platform, alongside NestBot, has become a central hub for OWASP projects, chapters, users, and aggregated contribution opportunities.

OWASP Nest’s success is a testament to many valuable [community contributions](https://github.com/OWASP/Nest/graphs/contributors), shaping and improving the project in countless ways.

No other OWASP projects' code was used in OWASP Nest's development. While explicit attribution (other than per MIT license) is not required, contributors and other OWASP project leaders are welcome to provide it at their discretion.
