The idea behind the project is to streamline OWASP project collection management while still keeping the current [https://owasp.org|https://owasp.org/] site risk profile unaffected â€“ all generated changes would still be going through PR review process. However, the structured project ecosystem with proper taxonomy, metadata, cross-links and standardized look would create a better user experience and help in navigation through existing OWASP ecosystem.

The project would utilize Github API to track projects "freshness" and to generate output pull requests automatically. It may also support a way for the project leaders to specify OWASP project metadata via standardized YAML files located in the project directories.

The complete feature list is not finalized yet and can be changed based on user needs.

### Road Map
My plan is to create a MVP before Sep 1, 2024. I'm pretty proficient in BE development however high-quality UI/UX part would take more time or need involvement of experienced front-end developer.
I strongly believe it's feasible to have a working product by the end of 2024 (contingent on infrastructure allocation or other technical/non-technical processes I'm not aware of).
